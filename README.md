# IT2351LAB3





Executive Summary

During this lab I will cover making EER diagrams. We will make several diagrams using the information given. I will also write Scripts to add indexes to my  database.Lastly I will create a view using two or more tables. 




Part 6 Explanation 
It is helpful in a business as it shows what product customers buy in large quantity 
and their preferred means of shipment. This information is collected from different 
tables and presented as a view without having to create a new table. The view will
always be automatically updated with new data that comes in.




Conclusion 
 This was definitely one of the more harder labs in my opinion. I do however feel more confident in the material.The EER diagram was challening but i did find a different source to create it with. I did enjoy completing this lab.
